# Dice-Roller

This simple application simulates rolling dice (D4, D6, D8, etc.). I've used it for my Pathfinder campaigns. It's a C# console application so it's not particularly spectacular, but it was a lot of fun to work on.

I wanted to get into C# development so I wanted to make something I could use. Enter Dice Roller!

It's on my list to come back and refactor this at some point (it's WAY too big for what it does), but there's more that I want to try to make.

This project was a lot of fun. It was pretty basic so I didn't need any tutorials, but I feel like it taught me a lot. I'm super excited to get to work on bigger and better things!
